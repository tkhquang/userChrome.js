### How to add userChrome.js support to my Firefox?
There are several ways to do so, I can't say [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7jj3uy/how_to_add_userchromejs_support_with_just_css/) is the best way to do so, but it's the easiest method. My scripts were all tested under that method by the way.

Also, if you are unfamiliar with `userChrome.css` (`userChrome.css` and `userChrome.js` are different), you should take a look at these links: [info](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/wiki/userchrome), [how to](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6xtm69/creating_and_editing_userchromecss/).
